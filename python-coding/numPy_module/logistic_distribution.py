# Logistic Distribution
# Logistic Distribution is used to describe growth.

# Used extensively in machine learning in logistic regression, neural networks etc.

# It has three parameters:

# loc - mean, where the peak is. Default 0.

# scale - standard deviation, the flatness of distribution. Default 1.

# size - The shape of the returned array.

# Example
# Draw 2x3 samples from a logistic distribution with mean at 1 and stddev 2.0:

from numpy import random

x = random.logistic(loc=1, scale=2, size=(2, 3))

print(x)
