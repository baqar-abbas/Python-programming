# Exponential Distribution
# Exponential distribution is used for describing time till next event e.g. failure/success etc.

# It has two parameters:

# scale - inverse of rate ( see lam in poisson distribution ) defaults to 1.0.

# size - The shape of the returned array.

# Example
# Draw out a sample for exponential distribution with 2.0 scale with 2x3 size:

from numpy import random

x = random.exponential(scale=2, size=(2, 3))

print(x)

# Visualization of Exponential Distribution
# Example

from numpy import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sns.displot(random.exponential(size=1000), kind="kde")

plt.show()
